**mulle-craft** builds two things:

* your *project* using [mulle-make](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-make)
* the dependencies of your project as specified by a *craftorder* file. This
file can be generated by [mulle-sourcetree](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sourcetree).

*mulle-craft* is unaware of the build tool to use (e.g. *cmake* or *xcodebuild*).
That is determined by *mulle-make*, which gets called from *mulle-craft*.
